 SFR 0xfeb0:
     Undocumented hardware starting here, something specfic to the 'W' series
     LC871 chips, which don't have a public data sheet. Guessing that this is
     a one-wire interface with some proprietary Sanyo/ONsemi format; I think
     it's the same one used by the TCB87-TypeC debug interface, but here it's
     being reused afaict mostly to generate the 750 kHz modulation pulses.
     Names here were gleaned from data files included with the toolthain.

 The word-wide ports WSADR and WRADR are both set (sometimes by writing twice,
 others by copying from WRADR to WSADR after writing WRADR) from model-specific
 tables of multiplexer control values. Marked in pins.txt as WRS.<bit>
